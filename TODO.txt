BACKLOG:
* Pre convoluted IBL in DX renderer.
** Map the mipmap levels. Shade them red to see if it works.
** Convolute to kingdom come.
* OptiXRenderer filtering.
** Reconstruction filters
*** Pr pixel.
*** Linear.
*** Mitchell.
** Filter neighbouring light samples before reconstruction.
*** Needs ray differentials.
* Materials revisited.
** Add coat.
* VS compiler flags /debug:fastlink in VS2015. Use /GL (Enable link-time code generation), /LTCG (Use Link Time Code Generation) and /INCREMENTAL:NO (Disable Incremental Linking)
** Perhaps create macros for setting up executables and libraries.
* Multiple cameras.
* Screenshot
** Render to offscreen buffer.
** Grab backbuffer on the CPU. (when the image is converged)
*** Request to composer or through the camera.
*** Expose certain backbuffer state pr camera/viewport in a renderer interface. Fx iteration_count, is_continuous_renderer and so on. Members that can be used to evaluate the 'doneness' of a backbuffer.
**** Investigate and potentially use C++ async concepts for this.
* Normals revisited
** Bump mapping
*** Filter bumpmap mipmaps using Toksvig05, SGGX or AGAA NDF construction.
** 'Fix' the normals at edges. Let the shading normal lerp towards the geometric normal at grazing angles. (Offset normal by -view_dir until the dot product is 0.)
** Offset slightly along the geometric normal as well? To avoid self shadowing and hard edges on tesselated balls.
*** Or perhaps offset along the incoming direction? That one should obviously not intersect anything else.
* BTDF
** Transmission factor.
*** Use IOR computed from specularity.
* Multiple scenes.
** Only nodes in a certain scene should be rendered.
** Should a scene node know if it is in a scene and in which? Store the root scene ID pr node?
* 3DS, STL and PLY loader.
* Serialize scene and models.
