BACKLOG:
* Typedeffed forward declared DX11 resource smart pointer. Get rid of those explicit releases. Use unique_ptr? Is it thin enough? COM Ptr?
** Use in EnvironmentManager.
* 64 bit oct encoded normals in the data model.
** 32 bit in DX11Renderer. Dump them in vertex position.w?
* Check for memleaks.
* Importance sample improvement? Gold material in SphereScene has a bunch of checker artefacts, possibly from the BSDF sampling or MIS weighting. The material is practically specular though.
** Pr pixel debug with pixel indication?
** Gold, which is a specular metal, has a specular weight of 0.6, so it's (supposedly) 40% diffuse.
* OptiXRenderer filtering.
** Reconstruction filters
*** Pr pixel.
*** Linear.
*** Mitchell.
** Filter neighbouring light samples before reconstruction.
*** Screen space photon mapping approach with MIS weights, then add a (recursive?) bilateral blur for everything not yet filtered.
*** Needs ray differentials.
* IBL rho intensity.
** Specularity increase is too strong.
** Metals are too bright at grazing angles.
** Perhaps computing The relation between GGX tint and rho would help figure out how much light scatters to the diffuse layer and how much the specular metal layers will reflect?
* Add coat.

** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nKb9hRYbPA
** Or just add a GGX layer on top with an iridescence parameter (red and blue fresnel offset relative to green.)
* VS compiler flags /debug:fastlink in VS2015. Use /GL (Enable link-time code generation), /LTCG (Use Link Time Code Generation) and /INCREMENTAL:NO (Disable Incremental Linking)
** Perhaps create macros for setting up executables and libraries.
* Multiple cameras.
* Screenshot
** Render to offscreen buffer.
** Grab backbuffer on the CPU. (when the image is converged)
*** Request to composer or through the camera.
*** Expose certain backbuffer state pr camera/viewport in a renderer interface. Fx iteration_count, is_continuous_renderer and so on. Members that can be used to evaluate the 'doneness' of a backbuffer.
**** Investigate and potentially use C++ async concepts for this.
* Normals revisited
** Encode in 32 bit in DX11 http://jcgt.org/published/0003/02/01/paper.pdf
** Offset slightly along the geometric normal as well? To avoid self shadowing and hard edges on tesselated balls.
*** Or perhaps offset along the incoming direction? That one should obviously not intersect anything else.
** Bump mapping
*** Filter bumpmap mipmaps using Toksvig05, SGGX or AGAA NDF construction.
** 'Fix' the normals at edges. Let the shading normal lerp towards the geometric normal at grazing angles. (Offset normal by -view_dir until the dot product is 0.)
* BTDF
** Transmission factor.
*** Use IOR computed from specularity.
* Multiple scenes.
** Only nodes in a certain scene should be rendered.
** Should a scene node know if it is in a scene and in which? Store the root scene ID pr node?
* 3DS, STL and PLY loader.
* Serialize scene and models.
