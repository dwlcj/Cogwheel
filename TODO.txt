BACKLOG:
* Tonemapping
** HDR backbuffer
** https://mynameismjp.wordpress.com/2010/04/30/a-closer-look-at-tone-mapping/
** What does Unreal use?
** Photomatix (local tonemapper)
* FXAA
* SSAO
* OptiX (filtering) backends
** Filter neighbouring light samples before reconstruction - Screen space photon mapping approach with MIS weights / Path filtering.
*** Output buffers
**** Material ID, texcoord, position, normal, ray dir, weight, light sample, indirect sample 
**** Define for toggling between compressed and full precision buffers.
**** Compressed directions.
**** Compressed radiance sample: half3 radiance, half PDF, 32bit encoded direction, float distance := 16 byte aligned.
*** Output screen space sample based on path/BSDF PDF.
**** Perhaps select a vertex if the BSDF PDF is less than 1 / PI or maybe even a bit more. Then vertices are selected roughly proportional to how 'diffuse' they are.
**** Trace ray footprint by assuming the ray is a cone. Then use Distributions::Cone::CosTheta(float angle) to compute the angle of each new cone after an intersection and use that for the density estimation kernel bandwidth.
** Mitchell filter
** Pass BSDF and light sample to the path tracing RGP and let it handle accumulated radiance.
* Material improvements
** Support roughness texture (alpha in diffuse texture)
** Metal specular tint should go to white at grazing angles.
** Importance sample improvement?
*** Gold, which is a specular metal, has a specular weight of 0.6, so it's (supposedly) 40% diffuse.
*** The black rubber ball in TestScene produces a lot of nearly black samples. Must be from GGX?
** Rho approximation.
*** GGX contribution seems too strong. Materials are too bright.
*** Perhaps computing the relation between GGX tint and rho would help figure out how much light scatters to the diffuse layer and how much the specular metal layers will reflect?
** Add coat.

*** Or just add a GGX layer on top with an iridescence parameter (red and blue fresnel offset relative to green.)
* Multiple cameras.
* Screenshot
** Render to offscreen buffer.
** Grab backbuffer on the CPU. (when the image is converged)
*** Request to composer or through the camera.
*** Expose certain backbuffer state pr camera/viewport in a renderer interface. Fx iteration_count, is_continuous_renderer and so on. Members that can be used to evaluate the 'doneness' of a backbuffer.
**** Investigate and potentially use C++ async concepts for this.
* Normals revisited
** Offset slightly along the geometric normal as well? To avoid self shadowing and hard edges on tesselated balls.
*** Or perhaps offset along the incoming direction? That one should obviously not intersect anything else.
** Bump mapping
*** Filter bumpmap mipmaps using Toksvig05, SGGX or AGAA NDF construction.
** 'Fix' the normals at edges. Let the shading normal lerp towards the geometric normal at grazing angles. (Offset normal by -view_dir until the dot product is 0.)
* BTDF
** Transmission factor.
*** Use IOR computed from specularity.
* Multiple scenes.
** Only nodes in a certain scene should be rendered.
** Should a scene node know if it is in a scene and in which? Store the root scene ID pr node?
* 3DS, STL and PLY loader.
* Serialize scene and models, perhaps just build GLFT importer and exporter at first. https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF
