* RT Renderer.
** OptiX
*** OpenGL output using interop.
*** Sphere intersection program (TODO about the one from pbrt3/ompf)
*** Render normals
* CUDA
** helper methods.
*** Debugging/error checking. Array management.
* Switch to underscores instead of camel case.
** Only missing in Cogwheel::Math.
* Prepend 'Cogwheel' to cogwheel includes.
* Multiple cameras.
** G-Buffer pr camera.
** Compose when all cameras are done.
* Multiple scenes.
* -Wall? -W3?
** It's a pain now that I'm using source code instead of dlls. All my libs are being checked an produce a ton of pedantic warnings.
** However it's also nice and produce some helpful warnings, fx about struct padding (which GLFW is full of, making that warning helpful and horrible at the same time.)
* Materials
** Coated rubber/metal.
* Load models.
** TinyOBJ
* Serialize scene and models.
* Screenshot
** Grab backbuffer. 
*** Request to composer, not renderers
*** Pass along function to evaluate if the backbuffer is 'ready', fx iteration count of certain viewport.
** Render to offscreen buffer.
* GL Renderer
* destroy - SceneNode, Camera

libs
* FreeImage. It has a commercial license.
* Emscripten
* LuaJit - OpenSource (Fallback to standard Lua if the target architecture isn't supported.)
